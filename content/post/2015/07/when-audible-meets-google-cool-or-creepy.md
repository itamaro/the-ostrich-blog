Last week, I finished listening to the [audio book version](http://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/All-the-Light-We-Cannot-See-Audiobook/B00IZGD864) of [All the Light We Cannot See](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476746583/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1476746583&linkCode=as2&tag=itamaostri-20&linkId=UX6QWUB3MR4BBK3K), by Anthony Doerr.

The book is wonderful, and I warmly recommend it. In the book, we go back and forth between the stories of the blind french girl Marie-Laure, and the orphan german boy Werner, as they grow up with the second world war shaping their lives.

This is not a summary or a review of the book, so I will not go further into describing the story. I would like to show you a random digest email I got from Google+, a few days after finishing the book:

Oh, have I mentioned that a significant part of the story takes places in Saint-Malo?? :-)

Take notice - I used Audible to buy and listen to the audio book, using my Amazon account. I got this **Airbnb** G+ post from Google+, urging me to explore a place I just "experienced" through a book!

Yes, I understand it was easy for Google to know that I bought the book, because I got the receipt to my Gmail. I'm not surprised that *they knew*. I'm surprised that they were able to time it so well with when I finished the book. I have many books in my Audible libraries. I don't listen to all of them immediately after purchasing them...

Anyway, I thought it was cool. I believe many will find this more creepy than cool. I think it's generally a good thing, if it allows Google to show me things that might interest me, when those things may be relevant for me. What do you think? Cool or creepy?
