*The Ostrich* is my personal and professional website and blog, where I write about subjects of interest. I hope that others who share my interests may find my content useful and interesting.

### Who am I?

Hey, thanks for expressing interest!

My name is Itamar Ostricher (hence the site name..). Currently I run this site on my own.

I'm 30-something years old. I live in Israel, with my amazing wife and twins, and their big dog-sister Noona.

### Blog subjects and themes

These subjects include (but are not limited to):

- Software engineering, scalability, development, design, quality, etc. ([category page](/category/software-eng/)).
- [Maker movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture "Maker culture on WikiPedia"), DIY projects, technology hacks, prototyping ([category page](/category/make/)).
- Mobile technology, Android platform and ecosystem, smartphones and apps ([category page](/category/mobile/)).

- An occasional personal topic, like parenting rants / insights ([category page](/category/personal/)).

### My objectives

Some of my objectives for this site include:

1. Have *some* control over my online presence (my "brand", even if I don't like that term :-) ).
2. Share knowledge, experience, and insights with a community of people who share my interests - and get feedback and input from that community.
3. Serve as an online portfolio.
4. Motivate myself to advance my personal projects and develop my skills continuously.
5. Generate passive income (want to help? why not [buy me some coffee?](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=AXPTQUWH26Y5A&lc=IL&item_name=ItamarO%20%40%20The%20Ostrich&item_number=itamaro%2ethe%2eostrich%C2%A4cy_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted) :-) ).
