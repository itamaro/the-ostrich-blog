If you enjoy the stuff I put on this website, you have several ways to help me keep it going.

### Give me your money

Purchase a "monthly subscription" with PayPal:

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="CU27LMZBDENSE">
<table>
<tr><td><input type="hidden" name="on0" value="Available Subscriptions">Available Subscriptions</td></tr><tr><td><select name="os0">
     <option value="It's the thought that matters">It's the thought that matters : $2.50 USD - monthly</option>
     <option value="Fund my domain">Fund my domain : $5.00 USD - monthly</option>
     <option value="Fund my web hosting">Fund my web hosting : $10.00 USD - monthly</option>
     <option value="I love you!">I love you! : $15.00 USD - monthly</option>
</select> </td></tr>
<tr><td><input type="hidden" name="on1" value="What's your favorite kind of content?">What's your favorite kind of content?</td></tr><tr><td><input type="text" name="os1" maxlength="200"></td></tr>

</form>

Give me a "weekly gift" via [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/Itamar%20@The.Ostrich/).

One-time contribution is also available as a PayPal donation: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=AXPTQUWH26Y5A&lc=IL&item_name=ItamarO%20%40%20The%20Ostrich&item_number=itamaro%2ethe%2eostrich%C2%A4cy_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted" target='blank'><img src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/x-click-but04.gif" class="plain-image" /></a>

### Click my affiliate links

I signed up for a couple of affiliate programs.

In blog posts that mention products (like [this one](Controlling My A/C With an Arduino)), I link to products on Amazon and eBay using my affiliate account. This means that if you buy these products through these links, I get a cut! In case you're worried - you don't pay extra for going through such a link! I get somewhere around 6%, in case you're curious.

If you're interested in starting your own website, you can sign up with [my HostGator affiliate link](http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=theostrich). If you want to use HostGator, that is.

### Other ways

There are ads at the bottom of the sidebar. I get paid for clicks.

If you'd like to support me in other ways, please [let me know!](/contact).
